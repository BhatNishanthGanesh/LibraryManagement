## Installation Steps

1. **Install Node.js:** Download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/). Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager) that you'll use later on.

2. **Install MongoDB:** Download and install MongoDB from the [official website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community). Follow the installation instructions to complete the process.

3. **Create a New Project Directory:** Create a new directory for your MERN stack project.

4. **Initialize the Project:** Navigate to your project directory and run the following command to initialize a new npm project:
    ```
    npm init -y
    ```

5. **Install Dependencies:** Install the necessary dependencies using npm:
    ```
    npm install express body-parser cors mongoose nodemon concurrently
    ```

6. **Set Up the Server:** Create a new file called `server.js` in your project directory and set up the server using Express.js and MongoDB. Refer to the Express.js and MongoDB documentation for details.

7. **Set Up the Client:** Navigate to your project directory and run the following command to create a new React.js app:
    ```
    npx create-react-app client
    ```

8. **Run the Project:** Open two terminal windows - one for the server and the other for the client. In the first terminal window, navigate to your project directory and run the following command to start the server:
    ```
    npm run server
    ```
    In the second terminal window, navigate to the client directory and run the following command to start the client:
